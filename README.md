# Amazon EKS Security Bootcamp </br> Visualize cluster traffic and identify security gaps

## Welcome

In this EKS-focused workshop, you will work with AWS EKS and Calico Cloud to learn how to improve the security posture of a cluster by using Calico Cloud to visualize traffic, use the policy recommender to get a baseline policy to secure workloads, implement zero-trust security for workloads to reduce the attack surface of applications running on EKS and to generate regular compliance reports to get a view of the security posture of the cluster once the policies have been applied.  

In K8s, the network architecture is much flatter, IP addresses are ephemeral and thus creates a challenge for the more traditional means of securing workloads. However the need for security does not go away with Kubernetes and remains a critical requirement for cluster-admins, devops and seurity teams to efficiently and effectively secure clusters in the cloud. Any potential security tool must understand the dynamic nature of K8s components and configure on/report data that is relevent and valuable to ensure the correct decisions are made when securing and visualizing the effects of the applied security on Kubernetes clusters. Calico Cloud offers 3 observability tools, Service Graph, FlowViz and Kibana, that we will look at in more detail in this workshop along with network policies and using these tools to check and improve security posture by implementing a zero-trust policy model and to generate reports for the workloads to ensure compliance with security standards.

You will come away from this workshop with an understanding of how others in your industry are securing and observing cloud-native applications in AWS, along with best practices you can implement in your organization.
